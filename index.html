  <p class="sub"><strong>Effective date:</strong> August 12, 2025</p>
  <p class="sub"><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Standard EULA</a></p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Agreement & Scope</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) are a legal agreement between you and the Wingman app publisher (“we,” “us,” or “our”) governing your use of the Wingman mobile application (the “App”). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms and to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Standard EULA</a>. These Terms supplement (and do not replace) the Apple EULA.</p>
    <p>Wingman is an operational companion for pilots. It provides tools for logging flights, tracking currency, managing expenses, and accessing aviation resources. Wingman is not a substitute for official aeronautical information, training, or regulatory compliance.</p>
